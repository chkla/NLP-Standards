Mediapark Cologne 
The MediaPark is a lively and architecturally unique location in Cologne’s inner-city district. Its 
buildings, which have been awarded many different prizes for architecture and design, are arranged 
in a star pattern around a central square and the bordering lake, offering a convenient combination 
of living, working and leisure amenities. The open design of the expansive traffic-free zone and the 
variety of concerns and interests of the people who work, live or spend their leisure time here gives 
the MediaPark its special atmosphere and appeal, based on a combination of open communication, 
creativity and professional skill. Participants at events can make use of a wide range of cultural and 
leisure facilities in the MediaPark before and after their event: Exhibitions, cinemas, a bookshop, and 
a large number of cafés and restaurants offering al fresco dining can be found directly on the central 
square, with extensive green areas located behind the different buildings. 
 
How to get to Mediapark using public transport: 
 
From Cologne Central Station, take lines 5, 16, 18 to Ebertplatz. Change to line 12 or 15 in the 
direction of Ringe. Get off at the Christophstrasse/ MediaPark stop. 
 
There is a direct S-Bahn connection between the Cologne-Bonn Airport and Hansaring, with the S13.

Giant slide on the playground at Mediapark 
Behind the Mediapark, directly below the August Sander Park, lies one of the coolest playgrounds in 
Cologne. The highlight is undoubtedly the two giant slides, the starting point of which was specially 
built on a raised area to make the slide particularly long. Even some adults will suddenly feel like 
being a child again. There are also large climbing pyramids, a circular race track for scooters and the 
like, a small locomotive and other play equipment.
